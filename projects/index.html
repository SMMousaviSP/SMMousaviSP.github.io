<p><em>November 2020 - August 2021</em></p>
<p>In this project, I developed a GUI to work with a stereotactic robot. This interface was aimed to be used by physicians to find the stereotactic coordinates for surgeries from more than 200 brain atlases. Since there were so many brain atlases and so many brain parts in each one of them, they needed the ability to search a brain part and see only the atlases that contained that brain part. Also, since there were many large brain parts that were available in more than 50 brain atlases, the physicians needed to know in which atlases the desired brain part is larger. I had access to a PDF of these atlases; I converted them to SVG files and tried to find each brain part and size of them from the SVG files, but it was not possible since the SVG files were auto-generated and several paths were responsible for forming a brain part. Finding the brain parts with image processing was also difficult since many brain parts had a dashed line border, making it hard to detect as a contour. I preprocessed SVG files to change every dashed line to a solid line and delete any unnecessary information in order to find brain part contours with OpenCV.</p>

  <div class="notice-content">Brain atlases used in this project were extracted from Paxinos &amp; Watson&rsquo;s The Rat Brain: In Stereotaxic Coordinates published by Elsevier. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m not allowed to share an example of these atlases; <a href="https://smmousavisp.ir/contact/">contact me</a> if you have a question.</div>
</div>

<p>I also created another version of SVG files containing only brain parts abbreviation. I used the coordinates of the brain part contours in these SVG files to find the name of each brain part. To increase accuracy, I matched the recognized brain part abbreviation to the text extracted from the PDF file. If there were no match, the algorithm would choose the closest brain part abbreviation available.</p>
<p>Hough transform was used to find the frame of each brain atlas in order to calculate the stereotactic coordinates.</p>
