    summary: |
      I'm interested in artificial intelligence and specifically deep
      learning. I'm working with python and TensorFlow for deep learning and
      I'm a full-stack web developer, for backend I use Django and Flask and
      for Frontend I use React js and Bootstrap. I like the idea of functional
      programming and in my spare time, I want to learn Clojure programming
      language and fundamentals of functional programming. I have experience
      in teaching programming languages (Python and Java), Data Structures and
      Theory of Languages and Automata.
